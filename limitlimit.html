    <p>Limit is as X approach to certian point Y is moving closer and closer to certian point<br>

    <h1>Explain the graph</h1>
    <p>Graph A as X approach 2 the limit =4 but when it ask what the value of x=2 it undefine</p>
    <p>Graph B As X approach 2 from left limit =-1 as X approach 2 from the right limit=1 however the limit of x apporach 2 is DNE because left and right is not equal there is no value of x=2 unless there is a solid point</p>
    <p>Graph C As X approach 2 from left limit= infinite as X approach 2 limit= infinite so As x approach 2 limit = infinite</p>
    <h1>Side note</h1>
    <ul><li>n^2x+Cos^2x=1</li>
      <li>0/0=indeterminate form</li><li>Use X^- indicate from left use X^+ from right</li><li>Limit and value is different based on the graph</li>
    <li>f(x)=sin(1/x) make limit not exist because limit of the graph do not exist due to oscilleting behavior</li></ul>
    <h1>When solving algebraiclly</h1>
    <ol><li>Plug apporaching x-value into the expression</li>
      <li>lim(x to 3)F(g(x)) means F(lim(x to 3)of G(x))</li>
      </ol>
