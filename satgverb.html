    <h1>Verb Tense</h1>
    <ol><li>Tense Consistency</li>
      <li>Always start by checking the tense of the verbs in the sentence in question, as well as the surrounding sentences (before/after)</li>
      
      <li>Present perfect and Past perfect</li>
      <li>Present perfect – has/have + verb. Describes an action that began in the past and that continues into the present. Signaled by “for” and “since.”</li>
      <li>Past perfect – had + verb. When a sentence describes two completed actions in the past, the past perfect can be used to describe the action that came first.</li></ol>
    <h1>Example</h1>
    <ul><li>Painter Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) <b>was</b> best known for her portraits. She <b>was</b> strongly influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, as revealed by her use of bright colors and dramatic symbolism. In her paintings, she <b>combined</b> elements of the classic Mexican tradition with surrealist techniques.</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Italy and France <b>have been</b> tourist attractions <u>for</u> hundreds of years/<u>since </u>the eighteenth century.</li></ul>
    <ul><li><u>By the time </u>Mae Jemison became an astronaut, she <b>had studied </b>science for many years.</li>
      <br>When the phrase “by the time” appears, however, the past perfect must be used.</ul>
    <h1>Important</h1>
    <ul><li><b>Correct answers to most verb questions are in either the simple past (was, did, ran) or the present. Answers that include more complicated tenses (would have done, will have gone) are virtually always wrong.</b></li>
      <br>
      <li> Most of the time, either the simple past or the past perfect can be used, e.g. “Before Mae Jemison became an astronaut, she <b>studied/had studied </b>science for many years.” When this is the case, you will not be asked to choose between the simple past and past perfect.</li></ul>
