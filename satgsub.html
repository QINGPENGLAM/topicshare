    <h1>Subject-Verb Agreement </h1>
    <ol><li>Singular verbs end in -s (she walks)</li>
      <li>Plural verbs do not end in -s (they walk)</li>
      <li>Most common irregular verb = to be. You must know the singular/plural forms of this verb in both the present (is/are) and the past (was/were).</li>
      <li>Collective nouns (group, country, school, team, board, government, etc.) are singular.</li>
      <li>Each, every, and neither are singular.</li>
      <li>The number = singular; a number = plural. </li>
      <li>Normal word order can be flipped so that the subject comes before the verb, making disagreements difficult to catch (e.g. Beyond the valley lies a house and lake).</li>
    </ol>
      <h1>Examples</h1>
      <ul><li> <u>Illegal logging </u>in Mexican forests <u>has</u> resulted in the destruction of the monarch butterfly’s habitat.</li>
        <li>(compound subjects — two singular subjects connected by “and.”)</li>
        <li><u>The Monarch and the Red Admiral</u><b> are</b> among the most common butterfly species in North America.</li>
        <li>Non-essential clauses can also be placed between subjects and verbs to distract from errors.</li>
        <li><u>The cochineal</u>, a small insect “discovered” by Hernán Cortés in present-day Mexico in 1519, <b>was</b> commonly used as a colorant in painting, sculpture, furniture and textiles from the mid 16th through the mid-19th century.</li>
