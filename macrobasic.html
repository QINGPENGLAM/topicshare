    <h1>Introduction to macroeconomic</h1>
    <h1>Definition</h1>
    <ul><li><b>Microeconomic </b> = study of interaction of buyer and seller for certain goods and service</li><br>
      <li><b>Macroeconomic</b> = study of aggeregate and overall commerical output and health of nation:analysis of factor such as unemployment,inflaction,economic growth and interest rates</li><br>
      <li><b>Economic </b>= study of how and why individuals and societies choose to allocate scarce resources the way and the consequences of those decision</li></ul>
    <h1>Basic economics concepts</h1>
    <ul><li><b>Scarctiy</b>= Society unlimited wants and limited resource. Our choices matter</li>
      <li><b>Normative statement</b> = Opinions that what you believe</li>
      <li><b>Postive statement</b> = You're able to test true or false</li>
      <li><b>Economic models</b> = Simplify assumption where in all kinds of field somehow related. Model are set in all esle equal(ceteris paribus)</li>
      <li><b>Command economic</b> = Communism type where government control the market's and the factory's amount of production and equally distribution </li>
      <li><b>Market economic</b> = Factory control production and price, have competition and production based on demand and data</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Most country are mixed economic where most o fthe factory control daily supplies while government control military supplies, foo statement etc</p>
    <h1>Checkpoint test 1 </h1>

      ) </a></li></ul>
    <h1>Opportunity cost and the Production Possibilities Curve</h1>
    <ul><li><b>Production possibilities curve (PPC)</b> = all given possibilitiesscenario create a curve</li>
      <br>Everything cover(left) is possible estimate but not efficient and everything outside(right) is not able to estimate
      <img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Production_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve.svg/1200px-Production_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve.svg.png width="500">
      <h1>Note</h1>
      <li>PPC illustrate concept of scarcity, opportunity cost, efficiency,inefficiency,economic growth, and contractions</li>
      <li><b>Opportunity cost</b> = when two item, the value of next best alterntive to any decision you make</li>
      <li><b>Efficient</b> = full used of employment resources in produciton; efficient combinations of output always be on the PPC</li>
      <li><b>Inefficient</b> = underemployment of any of the four economic resources(land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial abilty)</li>
      <li><b>Increasing oppoutunity costs</b> = beginning cost 10/unit later cost 30/unit</li>
      <li><b>Decreasing oppoutunity costs</b> = beginning cost 30/unit later cost 10/unit</li>
      <li><b>Constant opportunity cost</b>= beginning cost 20/unit later cost 20/unit</li>
      <li><b>In order to reach the impossible(outside of PPC) we had to increase resource(the porcutivity) such as land,captial,labor etc</b></li>
      <li><b>Contraction</b> = due to decrease in resource</li>
    <li>Changing from inefficient to efficient is not economic grorwth becasue it just reach max used of resoucre only if you increase the curve it's a economic growth</li></ul>
    <h1>Checkpoint test 2</h1>
    <ul><li><a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/macro-basic-economics-concepts#macro-scarcity>Khanacademy test (Opportunity cost and the Production Possibilities Curve
      )</a></li></ul>
    <h1>Comparative advantage and the gains from trade</h1>
    <ul><li><b>Absolute advantage</b> = two country with all same situation and has overall max production amount</li><br>
      <li><b>Comparative advantage</b>= two country or company opportunities cost(OC) compare which had lower OC = comparative advantage</li><br>
      <li><b>Specialization</b> = if you have comparative advantage of a certain goods you should keep producing it</li><br>
      <li>Gain from trade = when you buy in is lower than your OC which result outside of PPC</li><br>
      <li>Oc is reciprocal of each other in between two items</li><br>
      <li>It is impossible that a country has comparative advantage in all goods, self sufficiency= try to produce everything by themselves will end up poorer</li><br>
      <li>When question only given input,such as time, you have to convert into output then compare. For example, total work 8 hours and each worker produce one item per 2 hour then we know the rate is 4 and then compare between country</li><br>
     </ul>

    <h1>Demand</h1>
    <ul><li><b>Law of Demand</b>=all other factors being equal<b>(ceteris paribus)</b>, there is an inverse relationship between a good’s price and the quantity consumers demand</li><li>Change in quantity demand is change along the line the curve didnt change</li><li>When the change situation is true for all poin then it result in shift of curve</li>
      </ul>
    <h1>Factor that affect the demand</h1>
    <ul><li><b>Expectation of futre price</b> If you expect the price will go up in the future you'll rather buy it now than buy it later so the demand will increase</li>
      <li><b>People's income</b> You have more money means you are able to buy more the demand increase <b>(This only works for normal good)</b>For example when you buy a car if you have money you obviously going to buy a better care including factor like safety, or trying to brag about it</li>
      <li><b>Increase of population</b> More people = more demand </li>
      <li><b>People's preference</b> If a author is on a popular show and advertised it then people assume this item is better</li></ul>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Demand(Whole curve)</b> =all of the quantities of a good or service that buyers would be willing and able to buy at all possible prices</td>
        <td><b>Inferior good </b>= a good for which demand will decrease when buyers’ incomes increase.</td>
        <td><b>substitute good(other related product) </b>= goods that can replace each other; when the price of a good increases, the demand for its substitute will increase.<b>(Price of related product up demand up. Price down demand down. Because compare to other your product is more worth)</b> </td>
        <td><b>Demand curve</b>= a graph that plots out the demand schedule, which shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Quantity Demand(at a point)</b> = the specific amount that buyers are willing to purchase at a given price; each point on a demand curve is associated with a specific quantity demanded.<b>(Price up QD down , Price down QD up)</b></td>
        <td><b>Normal good </b>= a good for which demand will increase when buyers’ incomes increase.</td>
        <td><b>Complement good(Need to have both)</b> = goods that tend to be consumed together; when the price of a good increases the demand for its complement will decrease.<b>(Price up demand down, price down demand up. Because a ebook and tablet, tablet price up there less money to buy ebook if afford tablet)</b></td>
        <td><b>Demand schedule</b> = a table describing all of the quantities of a good or service (It can be used to make a demand curve)</td>

    <h1>Checkpoint test 4</h1>
    <ul><li><a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/macro-basic-economics-concepts#macro-scarcity>Khanacademy test (Demand)</a></li></ul>
    <h1>Supply</h1>
    <ul><li><b>supply(similar to demand)</b> = a schedule or a curve describing all the possible quantities that sellers are willing and able to produce, at all possible prices they might encounter in a particular period of time</li>
      <li><b>The law of supply</b> = positive relationship between price and quantity supplied, leading to an upward-sloping supply curve</li>
      <li><b>quantity supplied</b> = the amount of a good or service that sellers are willing to sell at a specific price</li> 
      <li><b>Change in quantity demand</b> = change along the curve</li><li><b>Change in supply</b>= change the curve left and right</li></ul>
    <h1>Factor that affect the supply </h1>
    <ul><li><b>the number of sellers in a market</b> more people selling = more supply there is</li>
      <li><b>the level of technology used in a good’s production</b>better technology= lower input and easier to get the supply</li>
      <li><b>the prices of inputs used to produce a good</b>input up supply down, input down supply up.(less input means you have more profit)</li>
      <li><b>the amount of government regulation, subsidies or taxes in a market</b>regulation up supply down because less profit</li>
      <li><b>the price of other goods sellers could produce</b>Other goods can earn more then seller would rather plants more profit goods</li>
      <li><b>the expectations among producers of future prices</b>Seller know the goods will increase future so supply safe till later to earn more</li>

      <h1>Terms</h1>
      <li><b>market</b>-  interaction of buyers and sellers where goods, services, or resources are exchanged</li>
      <li><b>shortage</b>- more demand than supply</li>
      <li><b>surplus</b>- more supply than demand </li>
      <li><b>equilibrium</b>- occurs when price has adjusted until quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded <b>(When there no shortage or surplus/ intersect point on graph)</b></li>
      <li><b>disequilibrium</b>- when an shortage or surplus occur theres disequilibrium</li>
      <li><b>equilibrium price</b>-“market clearing price” the price of the item at equilibrium status</li>
      <li><b>equilibrium quantity</b>- the quantity that will be sold and purchased at the equilibrium price </li>
