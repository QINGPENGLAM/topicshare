    <h1>Transitions</h1>
    <ul><li>Questions testing transitions are more about meaning than grammar</li>
      <li>Whenever you encounter a transition question, cross out the transition and state the relationship between the sentences/clauses (similar ideas/contrasting ideas) before you look at the answer choices.</li>
      </ul>
    <h1>Example</h1>
    Incorrect: The obvious reason for the construction of the Great Wall of China was protection, <b>since</b> China had no powerful enemies at the time construction first began.<br><br>(The two halves of the sentence express opposing ideas)<br>Correct: The obvious reason for the construction of the Great Wall of China was protection, <b>but</b> China had no powerful enemies at the time construction first began.
    <h1>Important</h1>
    <ul><li><b> If there is an OMIT/DELETE option, or an option without a transition, check it FIRST because it will usually be correct </b></li>
      <br>
      <li><b>When two transitions have the same meaning (e.g. but/yet) and are both grammatically acceptable in context, both can automatically be eliminated because no question can have more than one right answer. </b></li></ul>
